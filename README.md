#HTML5 Boilerplate with Compass

This is a straight forward fork of the very excellent HTML5 Boilerplate project.

I'm keeping a fairly simple set of scss files that recreate the CSS from the boilerplate and allow me to more easily add
my site-specific customisations on new projects using compass.

## Nothing fancy

I'm not using Compass modules or anything like that. I simply have a set of partials that I keep up to date with the html5
boilerplate project. My style.scss file then wraps those partials around any site-specific css that I write (using compass)
for a specific project.
